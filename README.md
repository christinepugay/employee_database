# [Employees Database](https://github.com/christinepugay/employee_database)

In this project, I created a relational database that stores three different tables: employees, departments, and regions.

The employees table was designed to store employees information including their employee id, names, email addresses, hire date, department, gender, salary, and region id. 

In the departments table, two data can be stored: department and division. The department column stores the department name while division categorizes the departments into its own category.

Lastly, regions will store information about the location of the store such as regions and countries where they are located. 

Take a look at the database schema here.

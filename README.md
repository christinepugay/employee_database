# [Employees Database](https://github.com/christinepugay/employee_database)

In this project, I created a relational database that stores three different tables: employees, departments, and regions.

The employees table was designed to store employees information including their employee id, names, email addresses, hire date, department, gender, salary, and region id. 

In the departments table, two data can be stored: department and division. The department column stores the department name while division classifies the departments into its respective category.

Lastly, regions will store information about the location of the store such as regions and countries where they are located. 

After I created the database using PostgreSQL, the data were inserted. Check out the code on how I accomplished this [here](https://github.com/christinepugay/employee_database/blob/main/database_create.sql). 

Using this database, I generated various [data reports](https://github.com/christinepugay/employee_database/blob/main/EmployeeDB_queries.sql) using various SQL querying techniques.
